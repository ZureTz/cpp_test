This code saves the \textbf{submission} DataFrame as a CSV file named \textbf{submission.csv}.

The \textbf{to\_csv} method of the \textbf{submission} DataFrame is called with two parameters.

The first parameter is the filename for the CSV file to be saved, which is \textbf{"submission.csv"} in this case.

The second parameter is \textbf{index=None}, which means that the row index labels in the DataFrame will not be saved to the CSV file.

After this code is executed, a CSV file named \textbf{submission.csv} will be saved to the current working directory with the predicted probabilities for each class for each sample in the testing data.
